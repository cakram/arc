* use PG_GLOBAL flag for anything in the kernel addresss space and check all
  the TLB flushing is done properly

* look at how caching should work for memory-mapped I/O devices like the local
  APIC and I/O APIC

* the PMM should be reworked to also support contiguous regions of memory

* check if in*_p() and out*_p() are still required

* split features into local CPU features and features that all CPUs share

* I/O APIC interrupts don't seem to work at all in Bochs, keyboard IRQ (IRQ1)
  doesn't seem to work in QEMU

* elf64 size checks
