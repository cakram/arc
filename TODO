* add locking to the virtual memory manager:
   - global lock for the higher half
   - per address-space lock for the lower half

* dlmalloc ABORT should call generic panic (rather than boot_panic) function
  when it is made

* use #defines in gdt.c instead of hardcoding the flags

* use PG_GLOBAL flag for anything in the kernel addresss space and check all
  the TLB flushing is done properly (also look into TLB shootdown when SMP is
  supported)

* look at how caching should work for memory-mapped I/O devices like the local
  APIC and I/O APIC

* documentation and testing of the new physical memory manager

* deal with the fact that some ACPI tables (e.g. FACS) do not use the standard
  header

* fill out the FADT structure

* check if in*_p() and out*_p() are still required

* consider how locking should work with port 0x61 (NMI status & control)

* use APs to boot more APs so that on systems where there are a large number of
  APs it doesn't take a long time to bring them all up

* TLB invalidation/panic should use an IPI to work on all processors

* check if setting the IMCR is required to switch into APIC mode

* detect and enable vmm_1g_pages
