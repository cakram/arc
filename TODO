* Add locking to the virtual memory manager:
   - global lock for the higher half
   - per address-space lock for the lower half

* dlmalloc ABORT should call generic panic (rather than boot_panic) function
  when it is made

* use #defines in gdt.c instead of hardcoding the flags

* heap_alloc() and heap_reserve() should allow setting of r/w/x flags

* use PG_GLOBAL flag for anything in the kernel addresss space and check all
  the TLB flushing is done properly (also look into TLB shootdown when SMP is
  supported)
