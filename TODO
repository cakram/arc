* add locking to the virtual memory manager:
   - global lock for the higher half
   - per address-space lock for the lower half

* use #defines in gdt.c instead of hardcoding the flags

* use PG_GLOBAL flag for anything in the kernel addresss space and check all
  the TLB flushing is done properly

* look at how caching should work for memory-mapped I/O devices like the local
  APIC and I/O APIC

* documentation and testing of the new physical memory manager

* check if in*_p() and out*_p() are still required

* use APs to boot more APs so that on systems where there are a large number of
  APs it doesn't take a long time to bring them all up

* split features into local CPU features and features that all CPUs share

* shouldn't mask all of LVT, I/O APIC interrupts don't seem to work at all in
  Bochs, keyboard IRQ (IRQ1) doesn't seem to work in QEMU
