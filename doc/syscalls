Arc System Calls

System calls are performed using the SYSCALL instruction.

The following registers are used for parameters:

RAX - system call number
RDI - argument 1
RSI - argument 2
RDX - argument 3
R10 - argument 4 (note this is normally RCX, but RCX is used by SYSCALL)
R8  - argument 5
R9  - argument 6

The kernel will trash the RCX, R11 and R12 registers. The result will be
returned in the RAX register (and the RDX register, if a second return register
is required.)

Note that R12 is defined to be callee-saved in the normal ABI, so the system
call wrapping functions in user-space must be careful to manually preserve it.
